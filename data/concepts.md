Contains AI concepts and research topics used to structure the dataset.

Concepts act as reusable thematic entities that connect papers across eras
(e.g., Attention mechanism, Convolutional networks, Diffusion models, RLHF).

Each concept is linked to:
- an era
- related papers
- broader topic clusters

This file ensures consistent topic naming across the dataset and enables
graph-style linking inside Geo.
